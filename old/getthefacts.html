        <h1>There's a lot of misinformation about voting by mail. Here's the facts:</h1>

        <p>With coronavirus still a very prominent threat across the US, many people are 
            understandably worried about voting in person during the 2020 presidential election.
            Some states have chosen to react preemptively and offer mail in ballots for all 
            registered voters, while others are insisting that things must go on as normal.
            <br><br>  
            The president has voiced his concern that "mail in ballots are very dangerous for 
            this country" because of cheaters", and some democratic leaders have echoed his thoughts 
            as well. Douglas Kellner, a co-chair on the NY State Elections Board pointed out that 
            voting by mail increases the likelihood that ballots will be intercepted or forged.
            
            but the truth is that mail in voting is 
            actually very safe.

        <p>
            1. All forms of voter fraud are very rare
            <br>
            - Trump's commision on voter fraud was disbanded in 2018 after finding no evidence
            <br>
            - Mail in voting is more vulnerable to fraud, however any fraud big enough to sway an
            election will likely be detected very quickly, such as the 2018 debacle in 
            North Carolina District 9
        </p>
    
        <p>
            2. Mail in voting does not give either party an advantage
            Voting by mail generally increases election turnout, but as all citizens have the right
            to their vote, it shouldn't be considered a political issue to allow them a way to safely
            exercise that right
        </p>
    
        <p>
            3. Many prominent government figures vote by mail
            - trump voted in florida from his home in new york in 2018
            - pence also voted by mail for the primary and general in 2018
            - Several cabinet members also voted by mail
